Description: This library contains functions that calculate various
        statistics of differential expression for microarray data,
        including t statistics, fold change, F statistics, SAM,
        moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also
        implements a new methodology called DEDS (Differential
        Expression via Distance Summary), which selects differentially
        expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of
        statistics using a weighted distance approach.
